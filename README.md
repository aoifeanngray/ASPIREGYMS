## Porfolio Project 1 
### Purpose: 
This website has been created to display the working knowledge of HTML and CSS by building a static front-end site to provide useful information to it's users.

The site is displayed in a manner that provides the target audience with the information
that is essential for the easiest users experience. The user will be looking for an insight into what the gym is like, what they will want to know such as what is on offer to them and the cost of the services and also can gain answers to their queries. 

## User Experience Design: 
### First time visitor goals: 
- to easily use the site 
- to gain more information about the gym / offers
- to be able to view the site on any device 

### Returning visitor goals:
- to re-check information 
- to act and buy membership etc. 
- to contact the gym 

### Frequent visitor goals: 
- to check opening times 
- to keep up to date with the any new offers or contact the gyms

## Design: 
All pages have an easily accessible navigation bar and they can access each page easily. 

The color scheme is widely focused on shades of red. This is a strong color and is very fitting to the Aspire Gyms aesthetic. The red is also complemented by other less intense colors but are very complementing colors to the red. 

The pages have a Google Fonts link to style the content of the pafes. The fonts are Ubuntu and Vollkorn.

### Business Goals: 
- to protray an attractive image of the Aspire Gyms and to entice new members to join. 
- allow easy contact between any user and the gyms.
- to provide the best prices and experience to the gym members and especially when they first encounter the gyms through the website. 

### Target Audience:
- New and existing members of Aspire Gyms. 

### User Goals: 
- gain more information on the gym / prices. 
- to contact / purchase memberships.

### Section 1 - Home: 

The home page's first section is containing an eye catching promotion and an 'About Us' section and a 'Locations' sections. 
The promotion gives the user a reasion to keep looking through the site and get more information about the gyms. The 'About Us' is an introduction to the gyms and how they came to be as the best gyms in Ireland. Of course the locations section is important so the users know where the gyms are located.

### Future Features: 
- Gym classes schedule to be added to a new page on the site. 
- Allow users to buy memberships online.
- Personal trainers profile page for each gym.
- Form isn't collecting any data as we have just covered HTML and CSS so to add data collection into the form code will be implemented in the future. 

## Testing and Validating:
- The three pages have been tested across all screen sizes for a responsive experience by creating media queries in the CSS file. Throughout my testing of the screen sizing for each page I had to go back through and change some size values in order to have them formatted to work correctly.

- On completion of my testing, I then put my code through validators to ensure my code was up to standard, to identify error so they can be corrected. I used the W3C validator for HTML and Jigsaw Validator for CSS.

## W3C validator results: 
## Home page
### Error 1:
- Changed the image names to remove the spacings. Also, all images are visible and responsive to screen size.

## Deployment: 
### To create the website: 
First I began by using the Code Institute Gitpod Full Template.

Secondly, I had to then 'create a new repository' using the template.
I gave it a repo name, then clicked create repository. 
From there I clicked the green 'Gitpod' button to begin my coding. 

### How I committed my work throughout the project:

- git add .  - I typed this into the terminal to add the files to the staging area. 
- git commit -m "explaining the updates" - I typed this command into the terminal to commit changes to the local repository. 
- git push - this pushes all committed changes to the GitHub repository.

## To publish the site link:
- Login to GitHub, go to your Repository.

- Go to the "Settings" Button on the menu and down to the 'pages' option. 

- Go to "Source", change to "Master Branch".

- Click Save and then back into the pages section to find your published link for the site.
