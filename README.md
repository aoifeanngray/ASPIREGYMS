## Porfolio Project 1 
### Purpose: 
This website has been created to display the working knowledge of HTML and CSS by building a static front-end site to provide useful information to it's users.

The site is displayed in a manner that provides the target audience with the information
that is essential for the easiest users experience. The user will be looking for an insight into what the gym is like, what they will want to know such as what is on offer to them and the cost of the services and also can gain answers to their queries. 

## User Experience Design: 
### First time visitor goals: 
- to easily use the site 
- to gain more information about the gym / offers
- to be able to view the site on any device 

### Returning visitor goals:
- to re-check information 
- to act and buy membership etc. 
- to contact the gym 

### Frequent visitor goals: 
- to check opening times 
- to keep up to date with the any new offers or contact the gyms

## Design: 
All pages have an easily accessible navigation bar and they can access each page easily. 

The color scheme is widely focused on shades of red. This is a strong color and is very fitting to the Aspire Gyms aesthetic. The red is also complemented by other less intense colors but are very complementing colors to the red. 

The pages have a Google Fonts link to style the content of the pafes. The fonts are Ubuntu and Vollkorn.

### Business Goals: 
- to protray an attractive image of the Aspire Gyms and to entice new members to join. 
- allow easy contact between any user and the gyms.
- to provide the best prices and experience to the gym members and especially when they first encounter the gyms through the website. 

### Target Audience:

## Testing and Validating:
- The three pages have been tested across all screen sizes for a responsive experience by creating media queries in the CSS file. Throughout my testing of the screen sizing for each page I had to go back through and change some size values in order to have them formatted to work correctly.

- On completion of my testing, I then put my code through validators to ensure my code was up to standard, to identify error so they can be corrected. I used the W3C validator for HTML and Jigsaw Validator for CSS.

## W3C validator results: 
## Home page
### Error 1:
- Changed the image names to remove the spacings. Also, all images are visible and responsive to screen size.
